- 👋 Hi, I’m @davidaparry
- 👀 I’m interested in:
-  Software architecture
-  Coding skills
-  Behavioural psychology
-  Cognitive valuation
-  Cognitive Behaviour analysis, and behaviour influencing
-  Theory of constraints, bottlenecks, process flow + constraint modelling and system efficiency and optimisation.
-  Academically: Im a Chemical Engineer and Computer Scientist.
-  In my worklife: I like to specialise in workflow-systems engineering.
-  I like to create workflow systems, take insights and optimise disparate complex user-flows by creating frameworks which can automate common user-flows, and free users to concentrate on their bigger "value-add" decisions.
-  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: Agile Theory of Constraints (ATM), Angular and stronger personal resilience than I have ever endured in a workplace: "U-Shaped" working... aka "its all on U"
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... anything that people can value my input on
- 📫 How to reach me ...
